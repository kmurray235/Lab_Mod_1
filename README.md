# Embarking on your Codewars journey

The point of this project was to create three different functions that first told the user whether an integer was even or odd, converted a number to a string and finally counted the number of vowel(s) in a string input.

## even_or_odd()
Function even_or_odd() takes a number and divides the number by 2. If there is no remainder, then the number was even, if there is a remainder then the number was odd.

## number_to_string()
Function number_to_string takes a number and casts it as string.

## get_count()
Function get_count takes a string called vowels that is equal to lowercase letters "aeiou" and searches for them in a given string using a for loop then returns the total number of vowel(s) in the given string.

## Biggest Challenge
The biggest challenge of these functions was setting up the for loop to count only the given vowels then casting it as a string so I could concatenate it and print out the message for the user.

## What did I learn?
I learned that even though the goal of the function may be simple, that it is easy to overcomplicate and overthink a solution. I also have a better understanding of how to call functions.
